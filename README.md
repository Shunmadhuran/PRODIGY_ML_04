Hand Gesture Recognition System
Overview
This repository contains a project to recognize hand gestures in real time using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and MediaPipe. The project includes functionality to:

Generate a dataset of labeled hand gesture images.
Train a custom CNN model to classify predefined gestures.
Perform real-time gesture recognition using webcam input.

Features
Recognizes five predefined gestures: Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down, Open Palm, Peace Sign, and Fist.
Tools for generating labeled datasets for gestures.
CNN-based model for gesture classification with training and validation.
Real-time gesture detection and classification using MediaPipe.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training CNN models.
OpenCV: For webcam integration and image preprocessing.
MediaPipe: For hand landmark detection.
NumPy: For data handling and preprocessing.
